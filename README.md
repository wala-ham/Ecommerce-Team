# E-Commerce Website (MEAN Stack)

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive e-commerce platform designed to provide a seamless shopping experience for users while offering robust administrative tools for managing the store. Built using the MEAN stack, the platform includes two distinct modules:
- **User Module:** Allows customers to browse products, add items to their cart, manage orders, and complete purchases through a secure checkout process.
- **Admin Module:** Provides administrators with full control over user accounts, product listings, categories, orders, and inventory. This allows for efficient management of the store's backend operations, ensuring smooth day-to-day operations.

The project is designed for scalability and flexibility, making it easy to extend and customize based on business needs.

The project consists of:
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB
